# What does it take to detect land surface phenology in sparsely vegetated drylands?

This is the code/data repository for the above analysis.   

There are two main sections. One analysis using a simulation of annual vegetation indices, another using unmanned aerial vehicle (aka. UAV/drone) images. They are each located in their respective folders. Figures are created with the `evaluate_` scripts. Other maps and conceptual figures are located in the `other` folder.
