Shawn D. Taylor, Dawn M. Browning, Ruben A. Baca, Feng Gao, "Constraints and Opportunities for Detecting Land Surface Phenology in Drylands", Journal of Remote Sensing, vol. 2021, Article ID 9859103, 15 pages, 2021. https://doi.org/10.34133/2021/9859103 

There are two main sections. One analysis using a simulation of annual vegetation indices, another using unmanned aerial vehicle (aka. UAV/drone) images. They are each located in their respective folders. Figures are created with the `evaluate_` scripts. Other maps and conceptual figures are located in the `other` folder.
